## Enviroment

```
- XCode
- Android Studio
- Command Line Tools

* Installing dependencies
You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

Node, Watchman
We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

- brew install node
- brew install watchman

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

* The React Native CLI

Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

- npm install -g react-native-cli

If you get an error like Cannot find module 'npmlog', try installing npm directly: curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh.
